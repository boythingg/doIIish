for the love of god stop saying you're a system when you're not even medically recognized, just say "*suspecting did/osdd*".

DID *requires* a medical diagnosis for a reason, your DID symptoms can be caused by MANY different disorders and mental illness. BPD, OCD, PTSD (the list goes on, it's not an easy to diagnosis disorder like anxiety or depression) all have to  be tested for as well during your testing for DID.
