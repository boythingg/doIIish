dni if you say "certain alter from a source do not interact ++ doubles do not interact" I wouldn't want to be your double anyway, we're not the same person or alter. That being said, there cannot be a double. **&&** fictives/introjects cannot choose their source telling them to not interact cause you have pseudomemories/"source"memories of them being a bad person is literally insane. This just seems like rolelplay.

*I don't even like telling people my source to be honest, my girlfriend doesn't like hers either.*
